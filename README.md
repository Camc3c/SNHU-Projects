CS-300 Project: CoursePlanner.cpp
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Course Planner is a C++ command-line application that helps users view and manage Computer Science course information. 
It allows users to load course data from a CSV file into a binary search tree, making it easy to display an alphanumeric list of courses or retrieve specific course details, including prerequisites.
The program features a simple menu for loading data, listing courses, and searching for individual courses, with automatic sorting and efficient data handling using the tree structure.
This tool is ideal for academic advisors and students looking to organize and access course information quickly.
